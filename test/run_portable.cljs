  "Run the whole suite under nbb, and EXIT NON-ZERO IF IT IS NOT GREEN.

      nbb --classpath src:test test/run_portable.cljs

  Every namespace in this library is `.cljc` and is meant to run on both
  runtimes. `clojure -M:test` answers for the JVM; nothing answered for
  ClojureScript until this file existed, so `portable` was a claim about a
  file extension rather than a measurement.

  ## Why the exit code is the point

  `cljs.test/run-tests` prints a summary and returns. A runner that only
  printed would report a red suite with exit 0, and every caller that checks
  an exit code — a shell, the mutation harness, a gate — would read that as a
  pass. **A check that cannot fail is not a check**, and this failure mode is
  the silent one: it looks exactly like a green run. So the summary is caught
  and the process exits `1` on any failure or error.

  ## Why the suite list is compared with the disk

  `clojure -M:test` discovers test namespaces by scanning the test path. This
  runner cannot — the list below is written by hand — so the way it breaks is
  that someone adds `foo_test.cljc` and does not add it here. The suite then
  shrinks, and the summary still says `0 failures`. The JVM run would still
  cover it, so nothing anywhere would say that ClojureScript had stopped.

  A namespace listed here but not loaded is NOT the risk: nbb throws
  `No namespace: … found` before anything runs, which is loud. The quiet
  direction is a file on disk that nobody named, so that is the one checked —
  `test/` is walked for `*_test.cljc` and the derived namespaces are compared
  with `suite`. Guarding the direction that cannot happen, and leaving the
  one that can, is how a check becomes decoration."
