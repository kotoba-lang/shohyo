  "諸表 — a trial balance folded into 貸借対照表 and 損益計算書.

  The name: 諸表 is the set of financial statements. Read it as \"the
  statements\". Not to be confused with `kotoba-lang/kessai` (決済,
  settlement/payment) — one is what you report, the other is money moving.

  ## What this library refuses to do

  **It does not guess what an account is.** `bookkeeping.trial-balance` says
  of itself that it proves arithmetic, not classification: an account is
  whatever string an entry named. Turning `\"cash\"` into an asset because it
  is spelled that way would put classification back where nobody declared it.
  So a **chart** is an argument, and an account not in it is not silently
  dropped — it is named, and the statement is marked incomplete.

  That is the whole design. A balance sheet that omits an account still
  balances. It is wrong, it looks right, and nothing about the output says
  which. Every other rule here follows from refusing that.

  ## Where it sits

  ```text
  bookkeeping.posting ─┐
  kakeibo.ledger      ─┼─▶ kotoba.banking ─▶ trial balance ─▶ kotoba.shohyo
                       ┘      (postings)        (balances)      (BS / PL)
  ```

  Balances come in as plain data — `{[account currency] {:balance n}}`, which
  is what `bookkeeping.trial-balance/balances` produces — so this folds a
  trial balance from anything, and `banking` stays the double-entry contract
  rather than becoming a reporting engine.

  ## Boundary with kanjō 勘定

  `cloud-itonami/kanjo` reads statements a listed company **disclosed** —
  EDGAR / EDINET XBRL — and normalizes JP-GAAP, US-GAAP and IFRS onto one
  canonical vocabulary. This library goes the other way: it **produces** a
  statement from your own ledger. They meet at that vocabulary. A chart may
  tag an account with a `:concept`, and the concepts this library accepts are
  exactly kanjō's, so an internally-produced statement and an externally-read
  filing are comparable line for line.

  The vocabulary is vendored (`resources/kanjo-canonical-concepts.edn`) with
  the upstream sha, not depended on: kanjō is an actor and this is a library,
  and a library depending on an actor has the arrow backwards. The copy is
  what makes the alignment machine-checked instead of a claim in prose.

  ## Sign convention

  Balances arrive debit-positive (debits minus credits), which is what a
  trial balance produces. Assets and expenses are debit-normal and appear as
  given; liabilities, equity and revenue are credit-normal and are presented
  negated, so a statement reads in the sign an accountant expects. The raw
  debit-positive figure stays on each line as `:balance` so nothing is lost."
