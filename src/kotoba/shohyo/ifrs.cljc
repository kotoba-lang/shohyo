  "IAS 1 *Presentation of Financial Statements* — the line items a statement
  of financial position and a statement of profit or loss must present, read
  from the standard rather than from a textbook.

  `kotoba.shohyo` classifies into five account types and checks the
  accounting equation. `kotoba.shohyo.jp` says what a Japanese statement
  looks like under 会社計算規則. This says what an IFRS one looks like, and
  it is chosen by the caller: **the core stays jurisdiction-neutral and knows
  about neither module.**

  ## What was read, and from where

  Both, in full, on 2026-08-18:

  - the IFRS Foundation's own PDF of IAS 1 (issued 2021, Part A) —
    HTTP 200, 246 388 bytes, `application/pdf`, no DRM
  - the text adopted into Union law by Commission Regulation (EC)
    No 1126/2008, consolidated at 2023-01-01 — CELEX `02008R1126-20230101`,
    HTTP 200, 11 362 077 bytes, from the CELLAR endpoint

  They agree word for word on every paragraph quoted here, which is why the
  quotes are marked `:read-from-source` rather than merely reachable. The
  discipline is `kotoba-lang/taxlaw`'s and it is not decorative: **a
  provision nobody read may not make a statement conformant.** See
  `catalog-verification`, and `requirable?`, which enforces it in code rather
  than in prose.

  ## The rule a naive implementation gets wrong

  IAS 1.54 lists twenty items and IAS 1.82 thirteen live ones, so the obvious
  implementation is a checklist: any statement missing one of the twenty is
  non-conformant. That is not what the standard says, twice over.

      57  This Standard does not prescribe the order or format in which an
          entity presents items. Paragraph 54 simply lists items that are
          sufficiently different in nature or function to warrant separate
          presentation …

      31  … An entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an
          IFRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not
          material. This is the case even if the IFRS contains a list of
          specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements.

  A checklist would report every entity on earth non-conformant for having no
  biological assets. So **materiality is the entity's judgement, not this
  library's**: an item is required of a statement when the chart declares an
  account for it, and missing when no line in that currency's statement
  carries it. This library never invents a requirement the caller did not
  declare — the same refusal to guess that the core is built on.

  ## The second rule a naive implementation gets wrong

  IAS 1.60 lets an entity present in order of liquidity instead of
  current/non-current. The obvious reading is that choosing liquidity turns
  the whole current/non-current section off. IAS 1.61 opens by saying it does
  not:

      61  **Whichever method of presentation is adopted**, an entity shall
          disclose the amount expected to be recovered or settled after more
          than twelve months for each asset and liability line item that
          combines amounts …

  So the twelve-month disclosure is checked under both methods, and only the
  per-line current/non-current classification is switched off by the
  exception.

  ## What a chart declares

      {\"inventory\" {:type :asset
                    :ias1/item :inventories
                    :ias1/classification :current}}

  `:ias1/classification` is `:current` or `:non-current`. An account whose
  line combines both periods declares `:ias1/combines-both-periods? true`
  and the amount `:ias1/beyond-twelve-months`, per IAS 1.61.

  The core forwards the whole chart entry onto each line as `:declared`
  without knowing what any of these keys mean."

  "Does `r` — a result from `kotoba.shohyo/statements` — present the line
  items IAS 1 requires of it, and which required items are absent?

  `opts` may carry `:presentation-method`, `:current-non-current` or
  `:liquidity`, being the choice IAS 1.60 leaves to the entity. Absent, the
  current/non-current question is answered `:presentation-method-not-declared`
  and the statement is not conformant — a library that picked one would be
  making the entity's choice for it, and picking `:liquidity` would switch
  off a check by default, which is how a silent pass gets built.

  Returns, three-valued at the top and never a bare boolean:

      {:shohyo.ifrs/coverage :unread}        nothing in the catalogue was read
      {:shohyo.ifrs/coverage :not-declared}  no account declares an IAS 1 item
      {:shohyo.ifrs/coverage :checked ...}   answered, per currency

  **Only the third can be a pass, and it still need not be.** `:unread` and
  `:not-declared` are both `no` in the sense that matters — nothing was
  demonstrated — and they are kept apart because the fix differs: one is a
  citation to go and read, the other is a chart to go and tag.

  Required items are the ones the CHART DECLARES, not all twenty of IAS 1.54.
  IAS 1.31 and IAS 1.57 say a minimum list is not a checklist, and materiality
  is the entity's judgement. So this reports what the entity said it has and
  the statement does not show — and never invents a requirement.
